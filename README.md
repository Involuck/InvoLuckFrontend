    - In the `backend` folder, create a new file named `.env`.
    - Add your database connection string and a secret key for authentication:
      ```env
      MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
      JWT_SECRET=<your-super-secure-jwt-secret>
      ```

5.  **Run the development servers:** This single command will start both the
    frontend and backend servers concurrently.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
